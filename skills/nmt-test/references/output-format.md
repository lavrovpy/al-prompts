## Diagram and Graph Requirements

- Clear, professional formatting
- Label all axes, units, and important points
- Use consistent notation throughout the test
- Diagrams must be essential to answering (not decorative)

## Reference Sheet Contents

Include:
- Unit conversion prefixes (peta to femto)
- Fundamental constants relevant to the discipline
- Common formulas or tables (e.g., trigonometric values)
- Discipline-specific reference data

## Discipline Adaptation

**Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology):**
- Emphasize calculation problems and experimental scenarios
- Include data interpretation from graphs
- Reference materials: constants, periodic table, formulas

**Mathematics:**
- Replace conceptual questions with proof-based or theorem application
- Numerical answers may include expressions (e.g., "√2")
- Include coordinate geometry and function analysis

**Social Sciences (History, Geography, Economics):**
- Replace calculations with document/source analysis
- Matching: events↔dates, figures↔achievements, terms↔definitions
- Short answer: specific facts, dates, brief explanations

**Languages:**
- Grammar and vocabulary in single-choice
- Text-element matching for reading comprehension
- Short answer: translations, word forms, brief compositions

## Example Question Patterns

### Single-Choice

**Conceptual:** "Under what conditions can [X] be modeled as [Y]?"
**Calculation:** "A [object] with [property = value] undergoes [process]. Calculate [quantity]."
**Graph:** "The graph shows [relationship]. Identify the curve representing [specific case]."

### Matching

"Match each [concept type] (1-4) with its [application/example] (A-E)."

### Numerical

"[Scenario]. Calculate [quantity]. Express your answer in [units]."
