# Question Type Specifications

## Type 1: Single-Choice (4 options)

**Used by:** History (Q1-20), Ukrainian Language (Q1-10), Biology (Q1-24), Physics (Q1-12)

**Format:**
- Question stem (text, quote, or visual source description)
- Exactly 4 options labeled А, Б, В, Г
- Only ONE correct option

### Distractor Design
- Plausible alternatives from the same domain/era/category
- Common student misconceptions
- Options should be parallel in structure and length
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above"

---

## Type 2: Single-Choice (5 options)

**Used by:** Mathematics (Q1-15), Ukrainian Language (Q11-25)

**Format:**
- Question stem with problem or scenario
- Exactly 5 options labeled А, Б, В, Г, Д
- Only ONE correct option

### Math-Specific Distractor Design
- One distractor: correct method, arithmetic error
- One distractor: wrong formula, plausible result
- One distractor: partial solution (incomplete steps)
- One distractor: sign error or unit confusion

### Language-Specific Distractor Design
- Options represent common grammatical errors students make
- Each option must be a complete, syntactically valid alternative
- For gap-fill: all options must fit grammatically into the sentence frame

## Type 3: Matching (4 items → 5 options)

**Used by:** History (Q21-24), Ukrainian Language (Q26-30), Biology (Q25-28), Physics (Q13-14)

**Format:**
- Left column: 4 numbered items (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Right column: 5 lettered options (А, Б, В, Г, Д)
- Each numbered item matches exactly ONE option
- One option remains unused (distractor)

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct match, max 4 per question.

### Content Patterns
- **History:** document↔name, person↔organization, event↔consequence
- **Language:** sentence↔phraseologism, word↔part of speech, sentence↔punctuation rule, sentence↔sentence type
- **Biology:** molecule↔function, pathogen↔disease, organism↔habitat, structure↔diagram label
- **Physics:** phenomenon↔application, discovery↔experiment

---

## Type 4: Matching (3 items → 5 options)

**Used by:** Mathematics (Q16-18)

**Format:**
- Left column: 3 numbered items (1, 2, 3)
- Right column: 5 lettered options (А, Б, В, Г, Д)
- Each item matches exactly ONE option
- Two options remain unused (distractors)

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct match, max 3 per question.

### Content Patterns
- Function↔graph sketch
- Mathematical question↔numerical answer
- Geometric transformation↔diagram

---

## Type 5: Chronological Sequencing

**Used by:** History (Q25-27)

**Format:**
- 4 events/excerpts labeled А, Б, В, Г
- Student orders them chronologically: 1 (earliest) to 4 (latest)
- Answer: sequence of letters (e.g., "ВАГБ")

**Scoring:**
- 3 pts: all 4 positions correct
- 2 pts: 3 positions correct
- 1 pt: 2 positions correct
- 0 pts: fewer than 2 correct

### Design Requirements
- Events must be clearly datable — no ambiguous chronology
- All events from the same broad era/theme
- Minimum ~5 years between adjacent events to avoid ambiguity
- Can use event descriptions OR primary source excerpts

---

## Type 6: Multi-Select (3 from 7)

**Used by:** History (Q28-30)

**Format:**
- 7 numbered statements (1-7) about a single topic
- Exactly 3 are correct
- Student selects the 3 correct numbers

**Scoring:**
- 3 pts: all 3 correct
- 2 pts: 2 correct (no incorrect selected)
- 1 pt: 1 correct (no incorrect selected)
- 0 pts: none correct

### Design Requirements
- All 7 statements about the same topic/event/phenomenon
- Incorrect statements should be plausible: anachronisms, attributes of related events, exaggerations
- Correct statements should not be trivially obvious

---

## Type 7: Numerical Answer (open-ended)

**Used by:** Mathematics (Q19-22), Physics (Q15-20)

**Format:**
- Problem requiring computation
- Answer: decimal number (using comma as decimal separator)
- Answer box: `___,___`

**Scoring:** 0 or 2 points per question.

### Design Requirements
- Answers should be "clean" numbers (integers or simple decimals)
- Increasing difficulty progression
- Provide graphs/diagrams (described textually) where needed
- **Math topics:** integration, applied math, 3D geometry, equations with parameters
- **Physics topics:** kinematics, statics, thermodynamics, circuits, oscillations, nuclear decay
- Physics: always specify answer units in the question ("Відповідь запишіть у [units]")

---

## Type 8: Three-Column Select

**Used by:** Biology (Q29-30)

**Format:**
- 3 independent columns, each with 3 numbered options (1, 2, 3)
- Student selects one option from each column
- Answer: 3-digit number (one digit per column, left to right)

**Scoring:**
- 3 pts: all 3 correct
- 2 pts: 2 correct
- 1 pt: 1 correct
- 0 pts: none correct

### Design Requirements
- Each column represents a different attribute of a single concept (e.g., body covering / circulatory system / representative)
- Columns are independent — correctness of one doesn't depend on others
- All 3 options per column must be plausible
- Common patterns: organism classification (trait, system feature, species example), process characterization (statement, substance class, location)
