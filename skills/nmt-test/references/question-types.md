# Question Type Specifications

## Type 1: Single-Choice Questions

**Format:**
- Present a problem, scenario, or concept
- Exactly 4 answer options labeled А, Б, В, Г (or A, B, C, D based on config)
- Only ONE correct option
- Distractors should be plausible and based on common misconceptions

### Cognitive Levels to Cover

1. **Conceptual Understanding** (3-4 questions): Principles, definitions, when/how concepts apply
   - "In which situation can [object] be considered as [simplified model]?"
   - "Which statement correctly describes [phenomenon]?"

2. **Graph/Diagram Interpretation** (2-3 questions): Reading and interpreting visual information
   - Include a graph or diagram
   - Ask to identify which curve/point represents a specific process or condition

3. **Calculation-Based** (3-4 questions): Numerical computation
   - Provide all necessary numerical data
   - All options should have correct units
   - Distractors should result from common calculation errors

4. **Application/Analysis** (2-3 questions): Real-world or novel scenarios
   - Require multi-step reasoning
   - Test ability to connect multiple concepts

### Distractor Design Principles

- One distractor: correct formula but wrong substitution
- One distractor: wrong formula but plausible result
- One distractor: common conceptual misconception
- Distractors should be similar length and structure to the correct answer

## Type 2: Matching Questions

**Format:**
- Left column: 4 numbered items (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Right column: 5 lettered options (А, Б, В, Г, Д / A, B, C, D, E)
- Each numbered item matches exactly ONE lettered option
- One lettered option remains unused (distractor)

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct match, max 4 per question.

### Content Types

1. **Concept-to-Application:** Phenomena/laws → Real-world applications
2. **Discovery-to-Evidence:** Theories → Experiments/observations
3. **Term-to-Definition:** Technical terms → Definitions/properties
4. **Process-to-Outcome:** Processes → Results/products

### Design Requirements

- Items in each column from the same general topic area
- Unused option should be plausible but clearly not matching
- Avoid options that could reasonably match multiple items

---

## Type 3: Short Numerical Answer Questions

**Format:**
- Problem requiring calculation
- Student provides numerical answer as a decimal
- Specify unit of measurement in the question
- Answer should be a clean number (integer or simple decimal)

### Complexity Progression

- Questions 15-16: Single-concept (1-2 step calculations)
- Questions 17-18: Multi-concept (2-3 step calculations)
- Questions 19-20: Complex (3+ steps, combining multiple topics)

### Problem Types

1. Kinematics/Motion: time, distance, velocity, acceleration
2. Equilibrium: balance of forces, moments, quantities
3. Energy/Thermodynamics: heat transfer, efficiency, conservation
4. Circuit analysis: resistance, current, voltage
5. Wave/Oscillation: frequency, wavelength, period
6. Decay/Growth: exponential processes, half-life

### Design Requirements

- "Clean" numbers to avoid calculator dependency
- Include diagrams where spatial relationships matter
- Specify simplifying assumptions (e.g., "ignore air resistance")
- Provide necessary constants or reference data
